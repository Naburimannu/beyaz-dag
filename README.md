# Beyaz Dag

It is not far from Navekat and Suyab to the lake they call the Eye of the World. But the visions you sought there carried you much farther,
across mountains, deserts, marshes, across the Mother River to the lonely Mount Beyaz. Here, perhaps, you can convince the merciful goddess
who lives above the clouds to save your people from the plague.

Beyaz Dag towers solitary above the deserts. No rival peak dares rear itself nearby, though a desultory range of hills stretches southwards. The mountain’s western slopes fall off steeply into a deep blue lake; north lie the marshes that fringe the Mother River.

You never mastered sword and lance, like your brothers, but can shoot, ride, and wrestle as well as any of them.

Beyaz Dag teems with life: hyenas and gazelles in the desert scrub, deer, wolves, bear in the forests. Travelers you met on the Northern Road tell of other, darker things here: ruins, abandoned quarries, sunken grottoes...


Now you're almost through the marshes; the mountain rises to the southwest.

## Strategy Notes

* Fighting is dangerous and rarely beneficial.
** Archery is deadly, but arrows are in short supply.
** If you get out of sight of your enemies, they're not likely to pursue.
* Melee weapon skills also influence defense.
** To be effective, have a skill of at least 40 in any weapon you use.
* Choices are hard.
** Fighting the wrong enemy without a shield (and shield skill) may be fatal.
** Fighting the wrong enemy in melee instead of with a bow may be fatal.
** Switching between bow and shield at a bad time may be fatal.
* Wounds, exhaustion, and intoxication all interfere with skill use.
** The longer you wait to bandage your wounds, the less likely you are to do so effectively.
** You'll probably want to get your first aid skill up to 50.
** The more exhausted you are when you drink kumiss, the more you'll recover.
** Intoxication is cumulative if you drink frequently.

## Spoilers

* Grinding can yield about 400 skill points, but a typical playthrough may only see half that.
