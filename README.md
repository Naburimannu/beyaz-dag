# Beyaz Dag

It is not far from Navekat and Suyab to the lake they call the Eye of the World. But the visions you sought there carried you much farther,
across mountains, deserts, marshes, across the Mother River to the lonely Mount Beyaz. Here, perhaps, you can convince the merciful goddess
who lives above the clouds to save your people from the plague.
